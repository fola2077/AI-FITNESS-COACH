# Test File Organization Summary

## Test Files Moved from Root Directory

All test files have been organized into the appropriate test directories for better project structure and academic presentation.

### Moved to `tests/unit/` (Component/Unit Tests):
- `test_difficulty_diagnostic.py` - Tests for difficulty system diagnostics
- `test_difficulty_logging.py` - Tests for difficulty data logging
- `test_enhanced_difficulty_diagnostic.py` - Enhanced difficulty system tests
- `test_feedback_system.py` - Feedback system component tests
- `test_scoring_fix.py` - Tests for scoring algorithm fixes
- `test_skill_level_fix.py` - Tests for skill level attribute fixes
- `test_threshold_boundary.py` - Tests for threshold boundary conditions

### Moved to `tests/integration/` (UI/Integration Tests):
- `test_chart_demo.py` - Chart display integration tests
- `test_compact_layout.py` - Compact layout UI tests
- `test_dashboard.py` - Dashboard integration tests
- `test_enhanced_chart_integration.py` - Enhanced chart system integration
- `test_enhanced_session_dashboard.py` - Session dashboard integration tests
- `test_final_feedback.py` - Final feedback system integration
- `test_final_integration.py` - Complete system integration tests
- `test_main_menu.py` - Main menu UI tests
- `test_manual_guide.py` - Manual/guide UI tests
- `test_sparkline_demo.py` - Sparkline widget integration tests

## Existing Test Structure (Preserved):
- `tests/unit/` - Contains component-specific unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - Contains end-to-end and UI integration tests
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and mock objects
- `tests/__init__.py` - Test package initialization

## Benefits of This Organization:
1. **Academic Presentation** - Clean project structure for submission
2. **Test Discovery** - pytest can easily find and run all tests
3. **Maintainability** - Clear separation between unit and integration tests
4. **Professional Standards** - Follows industry best practices for test organization

## Running Tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_skill_level_fix.py -v
```
