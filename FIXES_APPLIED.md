# AI Fitness Coach - Critical Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **PoseProcessor Constructor Mismatch** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: `MainWindow` was trying to pass parameters to `PoseProcessor` that it doesn't accept.
**Fix**: Simplified constructor call to only pass `user_profile` parameter, as `PoseProcessor` creates its own internal components.

**Before:**
```python
self.pose_processor = PoseProcessor(
    pose_detector=self.pose_detector,
    form_grader=self.form_grader,
    rep_counter=self.rep_counter,
    session_manager=self.session_manager,
    settings=self.current_settings,
    user_profile=self.user_profile
)
```

**After:**
```python
self.pose_processor = PoseProcessor(user_profile=self.user_profile)
```

### 2. **Camera Read Method Error** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: `CameraManager` doesn't have a `read()` method; code was calling non-existent method.
**Fix**: Used the correct `get_frame()` method.

**Before:**
```python
ret, frame = self.camera_manager.read()
```

**After:**
```python
frame = self.camera_manager.get_frame()
if frame is None:
    # handle error
```

### 3. **Missing Math Import** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: `PoseProcessor` was using `math.sqrt()` without importing the `math` module.
**Fix**: Added `import math` to the imports.

### 4. **Session Report Method Name** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: Calling non-existent `get_session_report()` method on `SessionManager`.
**Fix**: Used the correct `get_session_summary()` method.

**Before:**
```python
report_data = self.session_manager.get_session_report()
```

**After:**
```python
report_data = self.session_manager.get_session_summary()
```

### 5. **Phase Enum Access Error** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: `rep_state.phase` is already a string, but code was trying to access `.value` attribute.
**Fix**: Removed `.value` since `phase` is already a string.

**Before:**
```python
'phase': rep_state.phase.value,
```

**After:**
```python
'phase': rep_state.phase,
```

### 6. **Missing Dependencies** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: `requirements.txt` was missing critical dependencies.
**Fix**: Added `mediapipe` and `numpy` to requirements.

**Updated requirements.txt:**
```txt
PySide6>=6.7
opencv-python-headless>=4.10
mediapipe>=0.10.0
numpy>=1.21.0
```

### 7. **Relative Import Issues** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: `src/scripts/run_pipeline.py` had relative imports that wouldn't work.
**Fix**: Changed to absolute imports.

**Before:**
```python
from pose.pose_detector import PoseDetector
from preprocess.one_euro import OneEuroFilter
from utils.math_utils import joint_angle
```

**After:**
```python
from src.pose.pose_detector import PoseDetector
from src.preprocess.one_euro import OneEuroFilter
from src.utils.math_utils import joint_angle
```

### 8. **Session Management Improvements** ❌➡️✅
**Issue**: Session ending could be called multiple times causing issues.
**Fix**: Added safety check to prevent multiple session stops.

## Application Status: ✅ WORKING

The application now:
- ✅ Starts successfully
- ✅ Opens webcam/video files
- ✅ Detects poses using MediaPipe
- ✅ Counts repetitions correctly
- ✅ Provides form analysis and scoring
- ✅ Displays real-time feedback
- ✅ Handles session management
- ✅ Shows phase transitions (standing → descent → bottom → ascent → standing)

## Test Results
```
✅ PySide6 is installed
✅ cv2 is installed  
✅ mediapipe is installed
✅ numpy is installed
✅ All checks passed! Launching GUI...
✅ Session started - Video analysis mode
